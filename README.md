# Simulation of command 'ping'

------

This repository aim to carry out a program which could mainly finish the Basic Functions of  Commmand 'ping'，**Ping Simulation** is the best answer —— I have always focus on the user-defined programming。 You could use Ping Simulation：

> * Learning how command 'ping' works
> * For special needs in various kind of environment
